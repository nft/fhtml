//! fhtml — compiler for Fluid HTML, a token-cheap, Tailwind-native markup
//! language. See SPEC.md for the normative language definition.
//!
//! Implements the static markup layer (SPEC §1–§8, §11), the canonical formatter,
//! the template layer (SPEC §9 interpolation, §10.1–§10.2 statements),
//! and the composition layer (§10.3–§10.5 `def`/`+call`/`children` and
//! `include`) across the whole toolchain — render, `fmt`, and `--target=js`.
//! Includes need a file context: use the `_from` entry points (or the CLI,
//! which passes the source path); the string-only entry points reject
//! `include` since stdin has no base path. The `_vfs` variants take an
//! explicit file loader ([`Vfs`]) instead of the disk — a [`MemVfs`] file
//! map serves WASM hosts and embedders with in-memory templates.
